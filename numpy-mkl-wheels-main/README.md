# Wheels for Python on Windows, linked to oneAPI MKL

This repository provides unofficial binary wheels for open-source extension packages for Python on Windows, linked to the [Intel(r) oneAPI Math Kernel Library](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl/) (oneAPI MKL).

The files are unofficial (meaning: informal, unrecognized, personal, unsupported, no warranty, no liability, provided "as is") and made available for testing and evaluation purposes.

Source code changes, if any, have been submitted to the project maintainers or are included in the wheels.

The wheels can be downloaded from the [Releases](https://github.com/cgohlke/numpy-mkl-wheels/releases) page.

## Release 2025.10.28
